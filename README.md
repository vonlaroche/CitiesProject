# CitiesProject
Hey everyone. This is a project done with bootstrap 4 and custom css. 
It's a cities site I plan to expand by adding day/ night mode which toggles the site from day mode to night mode. 
Will probably include javascript as well.
Aiming for smooth transition with pictures and colors updating depending on the selected mode (day/ night).

# How to open
Clone repository and open index.html or go to https://vonlaroche.github.io/CitiesProject to view the site
